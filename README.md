# CPS-Group18

## Overview

This is a repository for all development data regarding Group 18's work toward the Cyberphysical Systems module. The scope of this project is a design sprint aimed at developing a scaled, soft-shelled Mars habitat structure that adjusts to aerodynamic shapes based on extreme wind patterns.  

The project team consists of:
- Abigail Hoover
- Richard Alexandre
- Richard "Blake" Goodwyn

## Mechanical Overview 
### (Refer to /cad folder)
The mechanical design of the structure consists of six mechanical arms spaced equally about the structure. Each one consists of a carefully developed 4-bar linkage system driven by a servo arm. The servo arm has a roller that is situated into a slot in a driving link.
